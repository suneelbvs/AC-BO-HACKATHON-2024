## Project 17: Comparative Analysis of Acquisition Functions in Bayesian Optimization for Drug Discovery

This project investigates the comparative analysis of various acquisition function methods on the efficiency of Bayesian Optimization (BO) in the drug discovery process, particularly focusing on small, diverse, unbalanced, and noisy datasets. The study will evaluate the impact of different acquisition functions, molecular featurization methods, and applicability domain (AD) across multiple drug discovery datasets to uncover optimal strategies and best practices for employing acquisition functions (AF) effectively in drug discovery challenges
