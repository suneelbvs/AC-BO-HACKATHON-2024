## Project 17: Comparative Analysis of Acquisition Functions in Bayesian Optimization for Drug Discovery

### Abstract
This project conducts a comparative analysis of acquisition functions in Bayesian Optimization (BO) for drug discovery, focusing on small, diverse, unbalanced, and noisy datasets. It evaluates the impact of different acquisition functions, molecular featurization methods, and applicability domain (AD) to uncover optimal strategies for employing AF effectively in drug discovery challenges.

### Installation
### Installation using individual packages:
To install an editable version of the package, run the following command:
```bash
pip install PyTDC==0.3.6
pip install xgboost
pip install torch
pip install gpytorch
pip install requests
```
### Tutorial
!python main.py (assuming you updated correct data_loader) for model building
